<p><strong class = "steps">Step 1:</strong> Heat the oil in a pan over a low-medium heat and fry the onion for 8-10 mins until softened and starting to caramelise. Stir in the garlic and tomato purée, and cook for 1-2 mins more. Tip in the chopped tomatoes, vinegar, oregano, chilli and 2 tsp sugar, then season well and bring to a simmer. Swill out the tomato cans with a splash of water and stir this into the sauce, then partially cover the pan with a lid and cook for 15-20 mins until the tomatoes have reduced to a rich sauce. Crush any large pieces of tomato with a vegetable masher, if you like. Stir through the turkey or chicken and any other cooked meat you want to use up.</p>
<p><strong class = "steps">Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, boil the kettle. Pour the hot water into a large saucepan, season with salt and bring back to the boil. Cook the pasta for a minute less than pack instructions or until al dente. Drain, reserving a mugful of the pasta cooking water.</p>
<p><strong class = "steps">Step 3:</strong> Tip the pasta into the sauce and stir to combine, adding some of the reserved water to loosen, if needed. Transfer to a baking dish, then tuck in the pigs in blankets or put on top. Scatter over the cheeses. Once cool, will keep covered and chilled for a day, or frozen for a month. Defrost in the fridge overnight before cooking.</p>
<p><strong class = "steps">Step 3:</strong> If cooking imnmediately after prep, heat the grill to high and cook for 8-10 mins until the cheese is bubbling and golden. If cooking from chilled or defrosted, heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6 and cook for 25-30 mins until piping hot and the cheese has melted.</p>
